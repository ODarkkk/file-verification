# file-verification

This is a simple Python program that verifies your files.

It has multiple hash options such as sha256, md5 and others.

It can run without a hash, but it only calculates and shows the file hash.
If you input the hash code it tells whether it's different or not.

To use the programme, download main.py to a path and then run the file in cmd with the following command: "python main.py". You must have python 3.0 downloaded on your PC.

Libraries used:

hashlib;
os;
tkinter.
